# Dotfiles

My preferred terminal environment, which consists of:

- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Installation

Download and install the MelsoLG font from [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmsquill/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Tmux Package Manager (TPM)

Use `prefix-I` to install plugins and `prefix-U` to update them.
